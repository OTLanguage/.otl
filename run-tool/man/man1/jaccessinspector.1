jaccessinspector \- examine accessible information about the objects in
the Java Virtual Machine using the Java Accessibility Utilities API
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[CB]jaccessinspector\f[R] tool lets you select different methods for
examining the object accessibility information:
.IP \[bu] 2
When events occur such as a change of focus, mouse movement, property
change, menu selection, and the display of a popup menu
.IP \[bu] 2
When you press the F1 key when the mouse is over an object, or F2 when
the mouse is over a window
.PP
After an object has been selected for examination, the
\f[CB]jaccessinspector\f[R] tool displays the results of calling Java
Accessibility API methods on that object.
.SH RUNNING THE JACCESSINSPECTOR TOOL
.PP
To use the \f[CB]jaccessinspector\f[R] tool, launch the
\f[CB]jaccessinspector\f[R] tool after launching a Java application.
To launch \f[CB]jaccessinspector\f[R], run the following command:
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R]
.PP
\f[CB]JAVA_HOME\f[R] is an environment variable and should be set to the
path of the JDK or JRE, such as
\f[CB]c:\\Program\ Files\\Java\\jdk\-10\f[R].
.RS
.PP
\f[CB]%JAVA_HOME%\\bin\\jaccessinspector.exe\f[R]
.RE
.PP
You now have two windows open: The Java application window and the
\f[CB]jaccessinspector\f[R] window.
The \f[CB]jaccessinspector\f[R] window contains five menus:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]File Menu\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]UpdateSettings Menu\f[R]

.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]AccessibilityEvents Menu\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Options Menu\f[R]
.PP
The items in \f[B]UpdateSettings\f[R], \f[B]JavaEvents\f[R], and
\f[B]AccessibilityEvents\f[R] menus let you query Java applications in a
variety of ways.

.B Update from Mouse
Determines the x\- and y\-coordinates of the mouse (assuming the
\f[CB]jaccessinspector\f[R] tool window is topmost) when the mouse has
stopped moving, and then queries the Java application for the accessible
object underneath the mouse, dumping the output into the
\f[CB]jaccessinspector\f[R] window.

.B Update with F2 (Mouse HWND)
Determines the x\- and y\-coordinates of the mouse (assuming the
\f[CB]jaccessinspector\f[R] tool window is topmost), and then queries the
Java application for the accessible object of the HWND underneath the
mouse, dumping the output into the \f[CB]jaccessinspector\f[R] window.

.B Update with F1 (Mouse Point)

dumping the output into the \f[CB]jaccessinspector\f[R] window.

.B Track Mouse Events
Registers with the Java application all Java Mouse Entered events, and
upon receiving one, queries the object that was entered by the cursor
and dumps the output into the \f[CB]jaccessinspector\f[R] window.
.RS

\f[B]Note:\f[R] If the mouse is moved quickly, then there may be some
delay before the displayed information is updated.
.RE

.B Track Focus Events
Registers with the Java application all Java Focus Gained events, and
upon receiving an event, queries the object that received the focus and
dumps the output into the \f[CB]jaccessinspector\f[R] window.

.B Track Caret Events
Register with the Java application all Java Caret Update events, and
upon receiving an event, queries the object in which the caret was
updated, and dumps the output into the \f[CB]jaccessinspector\f[R] window.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Because objects that contain carets are almost by
definition objects that are rich text objects, this won\[aq]t seem as
responsive as the other event tracking options.
In real use, one would make fewer accessibility calls in Caret Update
situations (for example, just get the new letter, word, sentence at the
caret location), which would be significantly faster.
.RE

.B Track Menu Selected | Deselected | Cancelled Events
